# Code templates for experiments using HRL

Repository containing templates to be used with [HRL](https://github.com/computational-psychology/hrl)

The repository works as a tutorial, showing step-by-step the different 
coding components that are necessary to build a psychophysical experiment
with HRL. 

If it is the first time using `HRL`, then start by looking at `0_basics`.

Alternatively you can take a look at a working experiment example,
for example the experiment inside `5_mutual_matching`.

In each experiment folder there is a markdown file `.md` that 
explains the logic, and a script `run_experiment.py` that starts the experiment;
this is always the entry point to the templates. So to run an
example, just do

`python run_experiment.py`

and type `demo` as observer name.
