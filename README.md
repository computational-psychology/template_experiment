# Code templates for experiments using HRL
Authors: Guillermo Aguilar - Joris Vincent 

Repository containing templates to be used with [HRL](https://github.com/computational-psychology/hrl)

The repository has 

- a tutorial, showing step-by-step the different coding components
that are necessary to build a psychophysical experiment with HRL. 

- ready to use experiment templates, if you have already used these 
templates before.

If it is the first time using `HRL`, then start by looking at the tutorial, 
starting by the folder `0_basics`.

In each experiment folder there is a markdown file `.md` that 
explains the logic, and a script `run_experiment.py` that starts the experiment.
This is always the entry point to the templates. So to run an
example, just do

`python run_experiment.py`

and type `demo` as observer name.
